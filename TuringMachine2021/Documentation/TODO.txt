TODO for TURING
1- make table machines as tables
4- make running possible in menu (Right click on machine in list if machines to run)
3- build more examples and make them runnable
2- build examples that combine table and combination machines
- improve editor such that you can type the verbatim text
8 - build plugin, not standalone version
5- write documentation: README, user manual, tutorial ++ Sort documentation
- make diagrams for combination machines
6- create unit tests = 2 test editor, 1 test runtime
7- better display of runtime status, step through (backup plan= print status after every process, status can be machine running, tape position etc.)
