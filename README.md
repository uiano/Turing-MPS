This project implements a simple Turing language in MPS. It is used to teach all important language aspects in MPS.

# Documentation
There is a [manual](Documentation/manual.md) in the documentation folder together with
an explanation of the [Turing language description](Documentation/language.md) in MPS.
Moreover, a list of current [TODO items](Documentation/TODO.md) is also there.

# Installation
Clone the repository to your machine. Then open a Turing Machine version in MPS and follow the building steps below. 


# Building
